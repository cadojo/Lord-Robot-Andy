10 years has passed since a fire broke out in Paris - leaving only a mask behind... As the love story continues in Coney Island, NY, The Phantom's undying love has grown for the soprano singer, Christine Daae. Christine, her 10-year-old son, Gustave, and husband, Raoul, the Viscount de Changy, travel to Coney Island where Christine is scheduled to sing for Hammerstein, but ends up singing for the mysterious Mister Y. They don't know what lies ahead. Christine and Erik confess about their past. Christine and Raoul reunite with old friends; and Christine sings for her mysterious masked man once more.... This time, her voice and her secret leads him to discover his massive conflict, inner heart. With Raoul there to stand his and family's end, the phantom reveals himself attempting to kidnap Christine. Raoul draws a pistol on him expecting a fight, but the phantom backs off and disappears before either man can make a move, ultimately leaving the audience shocked. This show is for all ages!
