Ten long years

Living a mere fa√ßade of life

Ten long years

Wasting my time on smoke and noise

In my mind

I hear melodies pure and unearthly

but I find

I can't give them a voice without you!

...

Please come back!

I need you

I need you!

You can't leave me here

Aching for you

Helplessly...



Please come back!

I need you

I need you!

Come back one more time

Come to me!



Please come back!

I need you!

Please come back!

I need you!

Come back one more time!

Come back to me!



[Solo: Clarence]



Please come back!

I need you!

Please come back!

I need you!



Please come back!

I need you!

Come back one more time!

Come back to me!
