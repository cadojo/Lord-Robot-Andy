Christine, her 10-year-old son, Gustave, and husband, Raoul, the Viscount de Changy, travel to Coney Island where Christine is scheduled to sing for Hammerstein, but ends up singing for the mysterious Mister Y. They don't know what lies ahead. Christine and Erik confess about their past. Christine and Raoul reunite with old friends; and Christine sings for her mysterious masked man once more....This story is so poor written and the song in this lovesong is called Dying masks a red heart of fears, with did not fit in the story at all.
