Ten long years

Living a mere fa√ßade of life

Ten long years

Wasting my time on smoke and noise

In my mind

I hear melodies pure and unearthly

but I find

I can't give them a voice without you!

...

In my dreams I see

green valleys that I have never walked

I'll never know

unless I go and find

new horizons

How can I face tomorrow, tomorrow!

When I knew where I was going

but now I'm lost, I am lost!



In my heart I'll find

new love that's true

but I'll need someone to show me the way

To turn back the tide

of the feelings I bury

Let the flood-gate let go let the flood-gate go

let the water come down



In my dreams I see

green valleys that I have never walked

In my heart

I'll find new love that's true

but I need someone to show me the way

to turn back the tide

of the feelings I bury

Let the flood-gate begin to open

Let the water rise and rise

Let the flood-gate begin to open

Let the water rise and rise
