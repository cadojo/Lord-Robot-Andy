You've jammed to Phantom. You've cried watching Love Never Dies. Now you desperately need new content from Lord Andy, but you don't know where to turn! Don't fret — thanks to Tensorflow, GPT-2, Python, and [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn), we can generate brilliant scripts à la The Lord Lloyd-Webber in no time at all.

## Overview
Some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous scripts will be placed as text files under [scripts](https://github.com/cadojo/Lord-Robot-Andy/tree/main/scripts). The file [generate.py](https://github.com/cadojo/Lord-Robot-Andy/blob/main/generate.py) will use `textgenrnn` to train natural language models, and generate new scripts for each play.

Enjoy some of Lord Robot Andy's newest works!
