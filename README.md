# Introducing Lord (Robot) Andy!

You've jammed to Phantom. You've cried watching Love Never Dies. Now you desperately need new content from Lord Andy, but you don't know where to turn! Don't fret — thanks to Tensorflow, GPT-2, Python, and [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn), we can generate brilliant scripts à la The Lord Lloyd-Webber in no time at all.

## Overview
Some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous scripts will be placed as text files under [scripts](https://github.com/cadojo/Lord-Robot-Andy/tree/main/scripts). The file [generate.py](https://github.com/cadojo/Lord-Robot-Andy/blob/main/generate.py) will use `textgenrnn` to train natural language models, and generate new scripts for each play.

Enjoy some of Lord Robot Andy's newest works!
